# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
f = lambda a, b: a + b
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
result = f(a,b)
print("The sum is:", result)
~~~

## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
